# Awesome SGSI Cases

My personal cases for the SGSI course from IST where I finished with a perfect grade of 20/20 which led me to be invited as Teaching Assistant for every semester since then.

## Organization

On the directory `cases` you can find all the cases from my year 2019/2020, where I had a grade of >=18/20 for each single one (except for case A, scoring 15/20).

## Comments

Usually the theory of the cases is similar enough to the point where everything I offer you sums up pretty much the bulk of this course.

Feel free to inspire yourself or straight up copy what I offer you my fellow students!
